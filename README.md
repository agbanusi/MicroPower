## Persistent Connections using socket.io
- On connection to the server, the server emits a 'connected' event with data of socket_id
- When the app has connected to the database and gotten the list of all meters being used, it should send an event to the server with the name 'accepted'
- The app should listen for the event with the name 'update' to update the units and daily conumptions so far and history, it will update evry hour
